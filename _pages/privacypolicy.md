# Privacy Policy
We take your privacy very seriously.

Snug requires access to your microphone to detect crying. We protect your privacy by processing the sound locally on your device. This is done in real-time so the audio is not recorded or saved anywhere. The audio never leaves your device and is not sent to any server or third party. In fact, we are unable to do so, as the app is set up without permission to access the Internet.

Beyond the standard information Google provides to developers, we don't use any third-party analytics or advertising frameworks. We don't log any information on you and we have no interest in doing so.                

**In short, we do not collect, transmit, distribute or sell any audio or data.**
